SCHOOL OF ABJURATION (Wizard Subclass)

Available at 2nd level

You focus your study on magic that blocks, banishes, and protects. Detractors say this tradition is about denial and negation, but you see it as protection and preservation.

FEATURES:

Abjuration Savant (2nd level)
• The gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved

Arcane Ward (2nd level)
• You can weave magic around yourself for protection
• When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest
• The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier
• Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead
• If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage
• While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains
• Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell
• Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest

Projected Ward (6th level)
• When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage
• If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage

Improved Abjuration (10th level)
• When you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check

Spell Resistance (14th level)
• You have advantage on saving throws against spells
• You have resistance against the damage of spells
