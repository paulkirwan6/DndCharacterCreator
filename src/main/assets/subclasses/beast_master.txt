BEAST MASTER (Ranger Subclass)

Available at 3rd level

Beast Masters forge a powerful bond with an animal companion, fighting alongside their beast as a team.

FEATURES:

Ranger's Companion (3rd level)
• You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures
• Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower
• Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and any saving throws and skills it is proficient in
• Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher
• The beast obeys your commands as best as it can
• It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to
• On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required)
• You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action
• Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action
• If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself
