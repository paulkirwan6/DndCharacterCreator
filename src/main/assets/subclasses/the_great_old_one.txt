Awakened Mind (1st level)
• Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures
• You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you
• You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language
• The creature can't respond to you telepathically

Entropic Ward (6th level)
• You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself
• When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll
• If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn
