OATH OF VENGEANCE (Paladin Subclass)

Available at 3rd level

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievous sins. These paladins are relentless hunters of evil.

TENETS OF VENGEANCE:
• Fight the Greater Evil: Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.
• No Mercy for the Wicked: Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
• By Any Means Necessary: My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.
• Restitution: If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

OATH SPELLS:
3rd: bane, hunter's mark
5th: hold person, misty step
9th: haste, protection from energy
13th: banishment, dimension door
17th: hold monster, scrying

FEATURES:

Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy (3rd level)
• As an action, present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation using your Channel Divinity
• Choose one creature within 60 feet that you can see
• That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened
• Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw
• On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage
• While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed
• On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage

Channel Divinity: Vow of Enmity (3rd level)
• As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet using your Channel Divinity
• You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious

Relentless Avenger (7th level)
• When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction
• This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks

Soul of Vengeance (15th level)
• The authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe
• When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range

Avenging Angel (20th level)
• You can assume the form of an angelic avenger
• Using your action, you undergo a transformation
• For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
  - Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet
  - You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage
• Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest
